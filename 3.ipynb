    "In a scenario where you have a dataset with a significant number of outliers, it's often advisable to use regression metrics that are less sensitive to outliers. One such metric that is robust to outliers is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mean Absolute Error is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and true values. Unlike some other metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), MAE does not square the errors, which makes it less sensitive to large outliers.\n",

    "The advantage of using MAE in the presence of outliers is that it gives equal weight to all errors, regardless of their magnitude. This means that large errors caused by outliers won't disproportionately influence the metric, making it a robust choice when dealing with datasets containing significant outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Support Vector Regression (SVR) or any other regression model on datasets with outliers, it's also a good practice to consider robust modeling techniques, such as adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., C, epsilon) and using kernel functions that are less sensitive to outliers (e.g., linear or polynomial kernels with lower degrees). Additionally, outlier detection and removal strategies can be employed to improve the model's performance on the majority of the data points."
