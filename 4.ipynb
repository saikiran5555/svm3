    "In cases where you have built an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel and both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are very close, either metric can be suitable. However, there are some considerations that may help you decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is in the original units of the target variable, providing a direct and interpretable measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "RMSE is in the same units as the target variable but presents a slightly more interpretable scale, as it represents the square root of the MSE.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is more sensitive to large errors due to the squaring operation in MSE. If your data contains outliers that you want to give less weight to, RMSE may be a better choice.\n",
    "Consistency with Model Choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider consistency with the choice of the polynomial kernel. If the polynomial kernel is chosen based on specific characteristics of the data, the choice of evaluation metric could align with the overall model strategy.\n",
    "Application-Specific Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the context of your application and any specific requirements or preferences. Some applications may prioritize a more straightforward interpretation (MSE), while others may favor sensitivity to larger errors (RMSE).\n",
    "In general, both MSE and RMSE are commonly used metrics for regression tasks, and the choice between them may depend on the specific preferences or requirements of your project. If the MSE and RMSE values are very close, you might choose the metric that aligns better with the interpretability and sensitivity considerations mentioned above. Additionally, it's often a good practice to report both metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance."
